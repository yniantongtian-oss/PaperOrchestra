# PaperOrchestra

A pluggable skill pack that lets **any coding agent** in Claude Code, Cursor,
Antigravity, Cline, Aider, OpenCode, etc. which can run the
[**PaperOrchestra**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2604.05018) multi-agent pipeline for
turning unstructured research materials into a submission-ready LaTeX paper.

## Why this exists

The paper defines a five-agent pipeline 
- Outline
- Plotting
- Literature Review
- Section Writing
- Content Refinement
  
that substantially outperforms single-agent and tree-search baselines on the `PaperWritingBench` benchmark (50–68% absolute win margin on literature review quality; 14–38% on overall quality). The paper ships the exact prompts for every agent in Appendix F.

This repo turns those prompts, schemas, halt rules, and verification pipelines into a set of **host-agent-executable skills**. There are **no API keys**, no SDK dependencies, no embedded LLM calls. The skills are instruction documents plus deterministic helpers; your coding agent does all LLM reasoning and web search using its own tools.

## How skills work here

Each skill is:

- `SKILL.md` — a dense instruction document the host agent reads and follows.
- `references/` — reference material: verbatim paper prompts (Appendix F), JSON
  schemas, rubrics, halt rules, example outputs.
- `scripts/` — **purely deterministic** local helpers: JSON schema validation,
  Levenshtein fuzzy matching, BibTeX formatting, dedup, LaTeX sanity checks,
  coverage gates. No network, no LLM, no API keys.

Everything else (LLM reasoning, web search, Semantic Scholar lookups, LaTeX compilation) is **delegated to the host agent** by instruction. See [`skills/paper-orchestra/references/host-integration.md`](skills/paper-orchestra/references/host-integration.md) for per-host invocation (Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, Cline, Aider).


## The seven skills

| Skill | Paper step | # LLM calls | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `paper-orchestra` | orchestrator | — | Top-level driver. Coordinates the other six. |
| `outline-agent` | Step 1 | 1 | Idea + log + template + guidelines → structured outline JSON (plotting plan, lit review plan, section plan). |
| `plotting-agent` | Step 2 | ~20–30 | Execute plotting plan; render plots & conceptual diagrams; optional VLM-critique refinement loop; caption everything. |
| `literature-review-agent` | Step 3 | ~20–30 | Web-search candidates; Semantic Scholar verify (Levenshtein > 70, cutoff, dedup); draft Intro + Related Work with ≥90% citation integration. |
| `section-writing-agent` | Step 4 | 1 | One single multimodal call: draft remaining sections, build tables from experimental log, splice figures. |
| `content-refinement-agent` | Step 5 | ~5–7 | Simulated peer review; accept/revert per strict halt rules; safety constraints prevent gaming the evaluator. |
| `paper-writing-bench` | §3 | — | Reverse-engineer raw materials (Sparse/Dense idea, experimental log) from an existing paper to build benchmark cases. |
| `paper-autoraters` | App. F.3 | — | Run the paper's own autoraters: Citation F1 (P0/P1), LitReview quality (6-axis), SxS paper quality, SxS litreview quality. |

Steps 2 and 3 run in parallel (see `skills/paper-orchestra/references/pipeline.md`).

## agent-research-aggregator *(optional)*

A pre-pipeline skill that bridges the gap between **scattered AI coding-agent
history** and the structured `(idea.md, experimental_log.md)` inputs that
PaperOrchestra expects. If you have been running experiments through Claude
Code, Cursor, Antigravity, or OpenClaw — but never wrote up a clean experiment
log — this skill does that extraction for you.

**It is optional.** If `workspace/inputs/idea.md` and
`workspace/inputs/experimental_log.md` already exist, the skill skips itself
and the pipeline proceeds directly. It only runs when the inputs are missing or
when you explicitly point an agent at a directory.

The simplest way to use it: just tell your agent the folder. If you have a
directory (a project root, an agent cache, any folder with research notes), the
aggregator figures out what's inside and structures it for PaperOrchestra.
The first thing it does is aggregate — scanning, extracting, and synthesising —
so even if the data is scattered across multiple files and formats, it produces
clean, reviewable inputs before anything gets written.

Run it **before** `paper-orchestra` (or let `paper-orchestra` call it automatically
when inputs are missing).

### What it does

```
[.claude/]  [.cursor/]  [.antigravity/]  [.openclaw/]
      │            │              │               │
      └────────────┴──────────────┴───────────────┘
                        │
                Phase 1: Discovery  (deterministic)
                        │
                Phase 2: Extraction (LLM — per batch)
                        │
                Phase 3: Synthesis  (LLM — one call)
                        │
                Phase 4: Formatting (deterministic)
                        │
             ┌──────────┴──────────┐
      workspace/inputs/      workspace/ara/
        idea.md                aggregation_report.md
        experimental_log.md    discovered_logs.json
                               raw_experiments.json
                               synthesis.json
```

The four phases are:

| Phase | Tool | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Discovery | `discover_logs.py` | Walks `--search-roots` to catalog every relevant log file across all agent caches. Prints a summary for user review before anything is read. |
| 2 Extraction | LLM (per ~50 KB batch) | Applies `references/extraction-prompt.md` to each batch; produces `raw_experiments.json`. PII is stripped; unverified numbers are flagged `[UNVERIFIED]`. |
| 3 Synthesis | LLM (one call) | Merges possibly-redundant experiment records into a single research narrative (`synthesis.json`). Detects multiple disconnected projects and pauses to ask the user. |
| 4 Formatting | `format_po_inputs.py` | Converts `synthesis.json` into `idea.md` (Sparse Idea format, §3.1) and `experimental_log.md` (App. D.3), ready for `paper-orchestra`. |

### Integration

**Install** — no extra dependencies beyond the base `requirements.txt`.

**Symlink** the skill into your host's skill directory alongside the others:

```bash
ln -sf ~/paper-orchestra/skills/agent-research-aggregator \
       ~/.claude/skills/agent-research-aggregator
```

For Cursor / Antigravity / Cline / Aider, follow the same per-host
instructions in `skills/paper-orchestra/references/host-integration.md`.

**Invoke** by telling your coding agent:

> "Aggregate my agent logs for paper writing" — or —
> "Prepare PaperOrchestra inputs from my cache" — or —
> "Turn my agent logs into a paper"

The trigger phrases are listed in the `description` field of
`skills/agent-research-aggregator/SKILL.md`.

### Parameters

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--search-roots` | cwd, `~` | Directories to scan for agent caches |
| `--agents` | all | Subset: `claude,cursor,antigravity,openclaw` |
| `--workspace` | `./workspace` | PaperOrchestra workspace root |
| `--depth` | 4 | Max scan depth (prevents runaway traversal) |
| `--since` | — | Only logs modified after this date (ISO 8601) |

### Example workflows

**From Claude Code memory + CLAUDE.md only:**

```bash
python skills/agent-research-aggregator/scripts/discover_logs.py \
    --search-roots . \
    --agents claude \
    --out workspace/ara/discovered_logs.json
# → finds .claude/projects/<hash>/memory/*.md and CLAUDE.md
```

**From a Cursor project (chat history + rules):**

```bash
python skills/agent-research-aggregator/scripts/discover_logs.py \
    --search-roots ~/my-project \
    --agents cursor \
    --out workspace/ara/discovered_logs.json
# → finds .cursor/chat/chatHistory.json and .cursorrules
```

**From Antigravity worker logs, restricted to the last 60 days:**

```bash
python skills/agent-research-aggregator/scripts/discover_logs.py \
    --search-roots ~/my-project \
    --agents antigravity \
    --since 2026-02-09 \
    --out workspace/ara/discovered_logs.json
# → finds .antigravity/workers/<id>/log.jsonl and output.md
```

**From OpenClaw sessions + run metrics:**

```bash
python skills/agent-research-aggregator/scripts/discover_logs.py \
    --search-roots ~/my-project \
    --agents openclaw \
    --out workspace/ara/discovered_logs.json
# → finds .openclaw/sessions/*/conversation.md and runs/*/metrics.json
```

**Full run across all caches:**

```bash
# Phase 1 — discovery
python skills/agent-research-aggregator/scripts/discover_logs.py \
    --search-roots . ~ --out workspace/ara/discovered_logs.json

# Phase 2 — LLM extraction (your agent handles this; validate afterward)
python skills/agent-research-aggregator/scripts/extract_experiments.py \
    --discovered workspace/ara/discovered_logs.json \
    --out workspace/ara/raw_experiments.json --validate-only

# Phase 3 — LLM synthesis (your agent handles this)

# Phase 4 — format + audit report
python skills/agent-research-aggregator/scripts/format_po_inputs.py \
    --synthesis workspace/ara/synthesis.json \
    --out workspace/inputs/ \
    --report workspace/ara/aggregation_report.md
```

After Phase 4, the workspace is ready for `paper-orchestra`. You still need
to supply `workspace/inputs/template.tex` (your conference LaTeX template) and
`workspace/inputs/conference_guidelines.md` (page limit, deadline, formatting
rules).

done
```

For Cursor / Antigravity / Cline / Aider, see `skills/paper-orchestra/references/host-integration.md`.

## Optional integrations

The pipeline requires **zero API keys to run** under any host with a native
web search tool.  Two optional integrations improve throughput or coverage:

- **[Semantic Scholar API key](https://api.semanticscholar.org/)** — Phase 2
  (citation verification) uses the public unauthenticated Semantic Scholar
  endpoint by default (≤1 QPS).  A free API key raises the rate limit and
  reduces 429 back-off during large runs.  The bundled
  `scripts/s2_search.py` reads `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` from the
  environment automatically — if the variable is absent it silently falls
  back to unauthenticated mode.  The repo never commits a key.

  ```bash
  export SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY="your-key-here"   # https://api.semanticscholar.org/
  # verify it's picked up:
  python skills/literature-review-agent/scripts/s2_search.py --check-key
  ```

  See `skills/literature-review-agent/references/s2-api-cookbook.md` for
  endpoint details, field reference, and error-handling notes.

- **[PaperBanana](https://github.com/dwzhu-pku/PaperBanana)** (Zhu et al.,
  2026) — the figure-generation backbone used by PaperOrchestra for Step 2.
  Runs a Retriever → Planner → Stylist → Visualizer → Critic loop that
  produces publication-quality diagrams grounded in real paper examples.
  Requires **one** API key — fill at least one, you don't need both:
  - **Google (Gemini)** — free at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/)
  - **OpenRouter** — at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) (preferred if both are set)

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dwzhu-pku/PaperBanana
  cd PaperBanana
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  cp configs/model_config.template.yaml configs/model_config.yaml
  # open model_config.yaml — paste your Gemini key into api_keys.google_api_key
  #                        OR your OpenRouter key into api_keys.openrouter_api_key
  export PAPERBANANA_PATH="/path/to/PaperBanana"
  ```

  That's it. Set `PAPERBANANA_PATH` and the plotting-agent uses PaperBanana
  automatically for diagram figures; falls back to matplotlib if unset.
  See `skills/plotting-agent/references/paperbanana-cookbook.md` for details.

- **[Exa](https://exa.ai)** — research-paper-focused search engine. The
  literature-review-agent can use it as a Phase 1 candidate-discovery
  backend via `skills/literature-review-agent/scripts/exa_search.py`. Set
  `EXA_API_KEY` in your environment (the repo never commits a key) and the
  helper queries Exa with `category: "research paper"`, returning 10–20
  candidates per query in the format the rest of the pipeline expects. See
  `skills/literature-review-agent/references/exa-search-cookbook.md` for
  the full recipe, query patterns, cost (~$0.007/query), and security
  notes.

  ```bash
  export EXA_API_KEY="your-key-here"   # https://dashboard.exa.ai/
  python skills/literature-review-agent/scripts/exa_search.py \
      --query "Sparse attention long context" --num-results 15
  ```

  Skip Exa entirely if your host (Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity) already
  has a native web search tool — the agent will use that instead.

## Quickstart

### Option A — you already have structured inputs

```bash
# 1. scaffold a workspace next to your raw materials
python skills/paper-orchestra/scripts/init_workspace.py --out workspace/

# 2. drop your inputs into workspace/inputs/
#    (idea.md, experimental_log.md, template.tex, conference_guidelines.md;
#     optional pre-existing figures go in workspace/inputs/figures/)

# 3. ask your coding agent:
#    "Run the paper-orchestra pipeline on ./workspace"
```

### Option B — your research is scattered across a directory or agent caches

If you have a project folder and haven't written up a clean experiment log yet,
just tell your coding agent the folder. The aggregator runs first — automatically
— and produces `idea.md` and `experimental_log.md` before handing off to the
pipeline:

```
"Write a paper from my work in ~/my-project"
"Turn my experiments in ~/lord into a paper"
"Aggregate ~/market-crispony and write a conference submission"
```

The agent will:
1. Scan the directory for agent caches (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.antigravity/`,
   `.openclaw/`) and any research notes it finds there.
2. Extract and synthesize them into `workspace/inputs/idea.md` and
   `workspace/inputs/experimental_log.md`.
3. Ask you to review both files, then run the full paper-orchestra pipeline.

You can also point it at any arbitrary directory — not just known agent caches:

```bash
# Phase 1: discover what's in the folder
python skills/agent-research-aggregator/scripts/discover_logs.py \
    --search-roots ~/my-project \
    --out workspace/ara/discovered_logs.json

# Then let your agent handle the rest ("Run paper-orchestra on ./workspace")
```

> The aggregator is **optional**. If `workspace/inputs/idea.md` and
> `workspace/inputs/experimental_log.md` already exist, it is skipped entirely.

A ready-to-run toy case lives at `examples/minimal/`.

## Fidelity to the paper

Every agent prompt in `skills/*/references/prompt.md` is reproduced **verbatim** from Appendix F of arXiv:2604.05018, with a header pointing to the page number. See `docs/paper-fidelity.md` for a design-decision → paper-page map.

On top of the paper, this repo adds a few deterministic hardening scripts (orphan-citation gate, anti-leakage grep, worklog-based rollback, provenance snapshots). These are clearly marked as out-of-paper improvements in `docs/paper-fidelity.md`.
