Encoded as deterministic logic in `scripts/score_delta.py`. This file is the
human-readable specification.

## Definitions

Let:

- `prev` = score JSON from the previous accepted iteration
- `curr` = score JSON from the just-completed iteration
- `prev.overall` = `prev.overall_score`
- `curr.overall` = `curr.overall_score`
- `subaxis_delta(axis)` = `curr.axis_scores[axis].score - prev.axis_scores[axis].score`
- `net_subaxis_delta` = `sum(subaxis_delta(a) for a in 6 axes)`

## Decision rules (in order)

```
if curr.overall > prev.overall:
    DECISION = ACCEPT_IMPROVED

elif curr.overall == prev.overall:
    if net_subaxis_delta >= 0:
        DECISION = ACCEPT_TIED_NON_NEGATIVE
    else:
        DECISION = REVERT_TIED_NEGATIVE_SUBAXIS

else:  # curr.overall < prev.overall
    DECISION = REVERT_OVERALL_DECREASED
```

The script exits with:

| Exit code | Meaning | Loop action |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | ACCEPT_IMPROVED | keep new draft, continue loop |
| 0 | ACCEPT_TIED_NON_NEGATIVE | keep new draft, continue loop |
| 1 | REVERT_OVERALL_DECREASED | rollback to prev, halt loop |
| 2 | REVERT_TIED_NEGATIVE_SUBAXIS | rollback to prev, halt loop |
| 4 | HALT_PLATEAU | keep new draft (accepted), halt loop |
| 5 | HALT_TARGET_MET | keep new draft (accepted), halt loop |

The script also prints a one-line decision string and a JSON object on
stdout for the host agent to log.

## Decision bands and the target-met halt

`score_delta.py` annotates every comparison with the prev/curr **decision band**
(`decision_band.py`): Accept (≥80), Minor Revision (65–79), Major Revision
(50–64), Reject (<50). These give the loop an *absolute* quality target on top of
the *relative* delta rules.

```
if DECISION in {ACCEPT_IMPROVED, ACCEPT_TIED_NON_NEGATIVE}:
    if curr.overall >= accept_threshold (default 80):
        DECISION = HALT_TARGET_MET        # exit 5 — keep current draft, stop
    elif consecutive_small >= plateau_streak:
        DECISION = HALT_PLATEAU           # exit 4 — keep current draft, stop
```

Target-met takes precedence over plateau: once the paper reaches the Accept
band there is no reason to keep iterating and risk a regression. Both 4 and 5
**keep** the just-accepted draft (unlike REVERT, which rolls back). Disable the
target-met halt with `--no-target-halt` (the band is still reported).

## Loop-level halt conditions

In addition to the per-iteration accept/revert decision, the loop halts
when ANY of these is true:

1. **Iteration cap reached.** Default 3 (configurable via env var
   `PO_REFINE_MAX_ITER`). Per the paper Table 7, the typical
   refinement count is "3× content refinement loop".
2. **REVERT decision** from `score_delta.py` (exit code 1 or 2).
3. **Empty weaknesses list.** If the simulated reviewer's `weaknesses`
   array is empty, there is nothing to fix — halt.
4. **Plateau early-stop (exit code 4).** `score_delta.py` returns
   `HALT_PLATEAU` when `N` consecutive accepted iterations each have
   `overall_delta < threshold`. Default: threshold=1.0 points, N=3.
   Configurable via `--plateau-threshold` and `--plateau-streak`.

5. **Target met (exit code 5).** `score_delta.py` returns `HALT_TARGET_MET`
   when an accepted iteration reaches the Accept band (overall ≥ 80). The
   current draft is promoted; the loop stops rather than risk a regression.

6. **DA CRITICAL standing (concession guard).** `concession_guard.py` exit 1
   means a Devil's Advocate CRITICAL finding is still standing (unresolved and
   not validly conceded). This **overrides an ACCEPT into a REVERT**: roll back
   and require the next revision to address the finding before continuing. Exit
   2 (a rejected concession with no blocked critical) is a WARN — the DA must
   restate the attack, but it does not by itself force a revert. See
   `da-reviewer.md`.

   The calling loop must pass `--consecutive-small <count>` to
   `score_delta.py` to track the streak across iterations:

   ```bash
   CONSECUTIVE_SMALL=0
   for iter in 1 2 3 ...; do
     # ... run refinement LLM call ...
     python score_delta.py \
         --prev iter$((iter-1))/score.json \
         --curr iter${iter}/score.json \
         --plateau-threshold 1.0 \
         --plateau-streak 3 \
         --consecutive-small $CONSECUTIVE_SMALL
     EXIT=$?
     # Update streak counter from script output
     CONSECUTIVE_SMALL=$(python -c "import json,sys; \
         d=json.loads(open('iter${iter}/delta.json').read()); \
         print(d['consecutive_small'])")
     if [ $EXIT -ne 0 ]; then break; fi
   done
   ```

   **Why this matters**: in practice, ~85% of the refinement gain comes
   in the first iteration (scores jump 5-8 points). Subsequent iterations
   typically improve by <1 point. Without early-stop, the loop runs 3 full
   LLM calls even when iterations 2 and 3 contribute near-zero value.

## Promoting the best snapshot

After halt, identify the iteration with the highest `accepted` overall
score:

```python
accepted_iters = [it for it in worklog.iterations if it.decision.startswith("ACCEPT")]
best = max(accepted_iters, key=lambda it: it.score.overall_score)
```

If the loop halted on REVERT, `best` is the iteration immediately *before*
the reverted one. Copy its `paper.tex` and `paper.pdf` to
`workspace/final/`.

## Worked example

Suppose:

| iter | overall | depth | exec | flow | clarity | evidence | style | decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 64.5 | 65 | 70 | 60 | 55 | 72 | 68 | (baseline) |
| 1 | 67.3 | 68 | 73 | 64 | 58 | 74 | 70 | ACCEPT_IMPROVED |
| 2 | 67.3 | 70 | 73 | 64 | 58 | 73 | 71 | ACCEPT_TIED_NON_NEGATIVE (Σdelta = +2) |
| 3 | 66.0 | 70 | 70 | 62 | 56 | 73 | 71 | REVERT_OVERALL_DECREASED, HALT |

Promoted: iter 2 (`final/paper.tex` ← `iter2/paper.tex`).
Score trajectory in the run report:
```
64.5 → 67.3 (accept) → 67.3 (accept tied) → 66.0 (revert, halt)
```
